C# Wrapper for MYDIGIPASS

Nowadays, electronic banking, online gaming, shopping and social networking have become a second nature. However easy, convenient and secure these various Internet services may seem, they bring justified concerns about online fraud and identity theft. With MYDIGIPASS.COM, VASCO brings strong authentication straight to the end-user. In just a few easy steps, users can take their online security to the next level. 

Advantages:

•	Two-factor authentication; users log in with a static password combined with a one time password (OTP) generated by their DIGIPASS authentication device. A DIGIPASS can be a hardware device or software installed on a mobile phone, laptop or desktop PC. The static password is "what the user knows" and is the first authentication factor. The DIGIPASS device is "what the user has" and is the second authentication factor. Both are required to successfully authenticate.

•	Single Sign-On; users no longer need to keep track of their passwords. They can use their MYDIGIPASS.COM account to authenticate with any online application or website that implemented our Secure Login API.

•	All traffic towards MYDIGIPASS.COM is encrypted (SSL). Credentials are never exposed.

This is a simple C# wrapper to integrate VASCO's MYDIGIPASS.com strong two-factor authentication into your web application.


To get it working

First you need to insert this wrapper into your asp.net project.
In the file "Default.aspx.cs" you have to set up the following fields:
-	The API redirection URI ("mydigipass.ApiRedirectUri")
-	The API Key ("mydigipass.ApiKey")
-	The API Secret ("mydigipass.ApiSecret")

In the file “Default.aspx” you have to make sure that you point to the correct mydigipass.com site. For test purpose you don't have to change the source of the javascript (https://sandbox.mydigipass.com/dp_connect.js). If you want to go live with your website make sure you are pointing to https://www.mydigipass.com/dp_connect.js.
Also in the “Default.aspx” page you have to adapt the parameters of the link (“client-id” & “redirect-uri”).


You will get the API Key and Secret from mydigipass.com, when you register a website to the application, following this steps:
-	go to the developer site
-	register / create a test site, with redirect_uri equal to your test site
-	you get a client-id and a client-secret
-	fill in the client-id and client-secret in the Default.aspx.cs file
-	open your testsite and try it out.
