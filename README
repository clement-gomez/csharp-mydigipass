C# Wrapper for MYDIGIPASS

Nowadays, electronic banking, online gaming, shopping and social networking have become a second nature. However easy, convenient and secure these various Internet services may seem, they bring justified concerns about online fraud and identity theft. With MYDIGIPASS.COM, VASCO brings strong authentication straight to the end-user. In just a few easy steps, users can take their online security to the next level. 

Advantages:

•	Two-factor authentication; users log in with a static password combined with a one time password (OTP) generated by their DIGIPASS authentication device. A DIGIPASS can be a hardware device or software installed on a mobile phone, laptop or desktop PC. The static password is "what the user knows" and is the first authentication factor. The DIGIPASS device is "what the user has" and is the second authentication factor. Both are required to successfully authenticate.

•	Single Sign-On; users no longer need to keep track of their passwords. They can use their MYDIGIPASS.COM account to authenticate with any online application or website that implemented our Secure Login API.

•	All traffic towards MYDIGIPASS.COM is encrypted (SSL). Credentials are never exposed.


This is a simple C# wrapper to integrate VASCO's MYDIGIPASS.COM strong two-factor authentication into your web application.

To get it working:

The first step is to register your application and provide your application settings.
You will then receive a sandbox client_id & client_secret for each test application you register.
You'll need these two parameters and the redirect_uri callback you configured to complete the next steps.
Please follow the developer guide at the following url, https://developer.mydigipass.com/getting_started.

In the file "Default.aspx.cs" you have to set up the following fields:
-	The API Key ("mydigipass.ApiKey")
-	The API Secret ("mydigipass.ApiSecret")
-	The API redirection URI ("mydigipass.ApiRedirectUri")

In the file "Default.aspx" you have to 
-	Configure the button's attributes ("data-client-id", "data-redirect-uri", "data-origin"). For test purpose "data-origin" points to the sandbox environment https://sandbox.mydigipass.com.
